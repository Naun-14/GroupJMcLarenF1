                <p class="card-text">McLaren's cars were originally named with the letter M followed by a number, sometimes also followed by a letter denoting the model.[366] After the 1981 merger with Project Four, the cars were called "MP4/x", or since 2001 "MP4-x",[367] where x is the generation of the chassis (e.g. MP4/1, MP4-22). "MP4" stood initially for "Marlboro Project 4",[368] so that the full title of the cars (McLaren MP4/x) reflected not only the historical name of the team, but also the names of the team's major sponsor and its new component part. Since the change of title sponsor in 1997, "MP4" was said to stand for "McLaren Project 4".[369] From 2017, following Ron Dennis' departure from the team, the naming scheme of the cars changed to "MCL" followed by a number.[370] Since 2017, McLaren have increasingly adopted orange colours, which the team dubs "papaya", designed to recall Bruce McLaren's liveries.</p>

            <p class="card-text">As part of McLaren's 60th-anniversary celebration, the team revealed a special livery for the 2023 Monaco and Spanish Grands Prix to celebrate their Triple Crown achievement. The Triple Crown livery is the amalgamation of the liveries of the three winning McLaren cars that forms the Triple Crown – the papaya of the M16C/D that won the 1974 Indianapolis 500 at the rear, the white of the MP4/2 that won the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix at the middle, and the black of the F1 GTR that won the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans at the front of the MCL60.[380][381] McLaren's IndyCar Series sister team also raced their version of the Triple Crown livery for the 2023 Indianapolis 500, with the liveries of the Nos. 7, 6 and 5 painted as the M16C/D, MP4/2 and F1 GTR respectively.</p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Chrome.</h5>
            <p class="card-text">For the 2023 British Grand Prix, in conjunction with primary partner Google Chrome, McLaren used a chrome livery in a throwback to the fan favourite livery from 2006 to 2014. The chrome livery was more commonly associated with the Vodafone McLaren years.</p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Stealth Mode.</h5>
            <p class="card-text">McLaren and OKX collaborated again for the 2023 Singapore and Japanese Grands Prix to race a predominantly black car with streaks of the standard papaya orange called "Stealth Mode".</p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Beach.</h5>
            <p class="card-text">McLaren and Vuse collaborated for a 3rd time for the 2023 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix (the previous 2 collaborations being in 2021 and 2022) to race a car with a similar livery to the main livery of 2023, but featuring more papaya on the front wing, along with an updated sidepod which features abstract shapes, influenced by rolling sand dunes and ocean waves.</p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Success.</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The MCL39 saw minimal changes from the previous year's car, due to a tradition where the team would run the same design the season after a championship win, and that the team would not change the livery substantially during a period of sustained success.</p>
