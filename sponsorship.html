    The Yardley of London cosmetics company became McLaren's first title sponsor and the team raced as Yardley Team McLaren. As a result, the livery was changed to a predominantly white one to reflect the sponsor's colours.

   Marlboro's red-and-white branding lasted until 1996, during which time the team went by various names incorporating the word "Marlboro", making it the then longest-running Formula One sponsorship (and still the longest title sponsorship, which has since been surpassed by Hugo Boss' sponsorship of the team, which ran from 1981 to 2014).

  <div class="card card-body">
   The team announced at the 2013 Australian Grand Prix that their partnership would conclude at the end of the 2013 season.[359] Despite explaining the decision to conclude the sponsorship as being a result of Vodafone's desire to reconsider its commercial opportunities, it was later reported that the decision to run the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix despite an ongoing civil uprising and protests against the race, and Vodafone's inability to remove their logos from the McLaren cars during the race as being a key factor in the decision to terminate the sponsorship.[360] Diageo-owned whisky brand Johnnie Walker, an associate sponsor since 2005, offered to take over as title sponsor at the end of 2013, but their offer of £43 million was turned down by McLaren chairman Ron Dennis, who believed it to be "too small."

   At the end of 2015, it was announced that McLaren was due to lose sponsor TAG Heuer to Red Bull Racing and thus McLaren brought Richard Mille to replace TAG Heuer from 2016 onwards. McLaren chief Ron Dennis later admitted to falling out with TAG Heuer CEO Jean-Claude Biver. In 2015, McLaren was without a title sponsor and was set to lose a further £20 million in sponsorship in 2016.[361] Between 2015 and 2017, the team competed as McLaren Honda due to their engine partnership with Honda.

   In 2019, British American Tobacco (BAT) agreed to a global partnership with McLaren under its "A Better Tomorrow" campaign to promote BAT's alternative smoking products Vuse (previously Vype) and Velo (previously Lyft).[371] The agreement has enticed a similar controversy to the Mission Winnow sponsorship with Scuderia Ferrari due to the association with tobacco companies.[372] In late 2019, BAT and McLaren announced the signing of an enhanced partnership deal that saw BAT become a principal partner of McLaren with increased branding position and the partnership being extended to the McLaren IndyCar Team.
