                        Bruce McLaren made the team's Grand Prix debut at the 1966 Monaco race (of the current Formula
                        One teams, only Ferrari is older). His race ended after nine laps due to a terminal oil leak.
                        The 1966 car was the M2B designed by Robin Herd, but the programme was hampered by a poor choice
                        of engines: a 3.0-litre version of Ford's Indianapolis 500 engine and a Serenissima V8 were
                        used, the latter scoring the team's first point in Britain, but both were underpowered and
                        unreliable. For 1967 Bruce decided to use a British Racing Motors (BRM) V12 engine, but due to
                        delays with the engine, was forced initially to use a modified Formula Two car called the M4B
                        powered by a 2.1-litre BRM V8, later building a similar but slightly larger car called the M5A
                        for the V12. Neither car brought great success, the best result being a fourth at Monaco.

                        For 1968, after driving McLaren's sole entry for the previous two years, Bruce was joined by
                        1967 champion and fellow New Zealander Denny Hulme, who was already racing for McLaren in
                        Can-Am. That year's new M7A car, Herd's final design for the team, was powered by Cosworth's new
                        and soon to be ubiquitous DFV engine (the DFV would go on to be used by McLaren until 1983) and
                        with it a major upturn in form proceeded. Bruce won the Race of Champions at the Brands Hatch
                        circuit and Hulme won the International Trophy at Silverstone, both non-championship races,
                        before Bruce took the team's first championship win at the Belgian Grand Prix. Hulme also won
                        the Italian and Canadian Grands Prix later in the year, helping the team to second in the
                        Constructors' Championship. Using an updated 'C' version on the M7, a further three podium
                        finishes followed for Bruce in 1969, but the team's fifth win had to wait until the last race of
                        the 1969 championship when Hulme won the Mexican Grand Prix. That year, McLaren experimented
                        with four-wheel drive in the M9A, but the car had only a single outing driven by Derek Bell at
                        the British Grand Prix; Bruce described driving it as like "trying to write your signature with
                        somebody jogging your elbow".

                                    <p> The year 1970 started with a second-place each for Hulme and Bruce in the first
                                        two Grands Prix, but in June, Bruce was killed in a crash at Goodwood while
                                        testing the new M8D Can-Am car. After his death, Teddy Mayer took over effective
                                        control of the team; Hulme continued with Dan Gurney and Peter Gethin partnering
                                        him. Gurney won the first two Can-Am events at Mosport and St. Jovite and placed
                                        ninth in the third, but left the team mid-season, and Gethin took over from
                                        there. While 1971 began promisingly when Hulme led the opening round in South
                                        Africa before retiring with broken suspension, ultimately Hulme, Gethin (who
                                        left for BRM mid-season) and Jackie Oliver again failed to score a win. The 1972
                                        season saw improvements though: Hulme won the team's first Grand Prix for 2+1⁄2
                                        years in South Africa and he and Peter Revson scored ten other podiums, the team
                                        finishing third in the Constructors' Championship. McLaren gave Jody Scheckter
                                        his Formula One debut at the final race at Watkins Glen. All McLaren drivers
                                        used the Ford-Cosworth engines, except for Andrea de Adamich and Nanni Galli who
                                        used engines from Alfa Romeo in 1970.</p>
                                    <p> The McLaren M23, designed by Gordon Coppuck, was the team's new car for the 1973
                                        season. Sharing parts of the design of both McLaren's Formula One M19 and
                                        Indianapolis M16 cars (itself inspired by Lotus's 72), it was a mainstay for
                                        four years. Hulme won with it in Sweden and Revson took the only Grand Prix wins
                                        of his career in Britain and Canada. In 1974, Emerson Fittipaldi, world champion
                                        with Lotus two years earlier, joined McLaren. Hulme, in his final Formula One
                                        campaign, won the Argentinian season-opener; Fittipaldi, with wins in Brazil,
                                        Belgium and Canada, took the Drivers' Championship. It was a close fight for
                                        Fittipaldi, who secured the title with a fourth at the season-ending United
                                        States Grand Prix, putting him three points ahead of Ferrari's Clay Regazzoni.
                                        With Hulme and multiple motorcycle world champion Mike Hailwood, he also sealed
                                        McLaren's first Constructors' Championship. The year 1975 was less successful
                                        for the team: Fittipaldi was second in the championship behind Niki Lauda.
                                        Hulme's replacement Jochen Mass took his sole GP win in Spain. </p>

                                    <p> At the end of 1975, Fittipaldi left to join his brother's Fittipaldi/Copersucar
                                        team. With the top drivers already signed to other teams, Mayer turned to James
                                        Hunt, a driver on whom biographer Gerald Donaldson reflected as having "a
                                        dubious reputation". In 1976, Lauda was again strong in his Ferrari; at
                                        midseason, he led the championship with 56 points while Hunt had only 26 despite
                                        wins in Spain (a race from which he was initially disqualified) and France. At
                                        the German Grand Prix, though, Lauda crashed heavily, was nearly killed, and
                                        missed the next two races. Hunt capitalised by winning four more Grands Prix
                                        giving him a three-point deficit going into the finale in Japan. Here it rained
                                        torrentially, Lauda retired because of safety concerns, and Hunt sealed the
                                        Drivers' Championship by finishing third. McLaren, though, lost the
                                        Constructors' Championship to Ferrari.</p>
                                    <p> In 1977, the M23 was gradually replaced with the M26, the M23's final works
                                        outing being Gilles Villeneuve's Formula One debut with the team in a one-off
                                        appearance at the British Grand Prix. Hunt won on three occasions that year, but
                                        the Lauda and Ferrari combination proved too strong, Hunt and McLaren managing
                                        just fifth and third in the respective championships. From there, results
                                        continued to worsen. Lotus and Mario Andretti took the 1978 titles with their 78
                                        and 79 ground-effect cars and neither Hunt nor Mass's replacement Patrick Tambay
                                        were able to seriously challenge with the nonground-effect M26. Hunt was dropped
                                        at the end of 1978 in favour of Lotus's Ronnie Peterson, but when Peterson was
                                        killed by a crash at the Italian Grand Prix, John Watson was signed, instead. No
                                        improvement occurred in 1979; Coppuck's M28 design was described by Mayer as
                                        "ghastly, a disaster" and "quite diabolical" and the M29 did little to change
                                        the situation. Tambay scored no points and Watson only 15 to place the team
                                        eighth at the end of the year.</p>

                                    <p> The 1980s started much as the 1970s had ended: Alain Prost took over from Tambay
                                        but Watson and he rarely scored points. Under increasing pressure since the
                                        previous year from principal sponsor Philip Morris and their executive John
                                        Hogan, Mayer was coerced into merging McLaren with Ron Dennis's Project Four
                                        Formula Two team, also sponsored by Philip Morris. Dennis had designer John
                                        Barnard who, inspired by the carbon-fibre rear wings of the BMW M1 race cars
                                        that Project Four was preparing, had ideas for an innovative Formula One chassis
                                        constructed from carbon-fibre instead of conventional aluminium alloy. On their
                                        own, they lacked the money to build it, but with investment that came with the
                                        merger it became the McLaren MP4 (later called MP4/1) of 1981, driven by Watson
                                        and Andrea de Cesaris. In the MP4, Watson won the British Grand Prix and had
                                        three other podium finishes. Soon after the merger, McLaren moved from Colnbrook
                                        to a new base in Woking and Dennis and Mayer initially shared the managing
                                        directorship of the company; by 1982, Mayer had departed and Tyler Alexander's
                                        and his shareholdings had been bought by the new owners. </p>

                        In the early 1980s, teams like Renault, Ferrari, and Brabham began using 1.5-litre turbocharged
                        engines instead of the 3.0-litre naturally aspirated engines that had been standard since 1966.
                        Seeing the growing importance of turbo technology, Ron Dennis convinced Williams backer
                        Techniques d'Avant Garde (TAG) to fund Porsche-built, TAG-branded turbo engines made to designer
                        John Barnard's specifications. TAG's founder, Mansour Ojjeh, would later become a McLaren
                        shareholder. In the meantime, McLaren continued with Cosworth engines, as former champion Niki
                        Lauda came out of retirement in 1982 to drive alongside John Watson in that year's MP4/1B. They
                        each won two races, with Watson notably taking victory from 17th on the grid in Detroit. At one
                        stage of the season, McLaren stood second in the Constructors' Championship. As part of a
                        dispute with FISA, they boycotted the San Marino Grand Prix. Although 1983 was less successful,
                        Watson secured another remarkable win in the United States, starting from 22nd on the grid at
                        Long Beach.

                                    <p> Having been fired by Renault, Prost returned to McLaren once again for 1984. Now
                                        using the TAG engines, the team dominated, scoring 12 wins and earning
                                        two-and-a-half times as many Constructors' points as their nearest rival,
                                        Ferrari. In the Drivers' Championship, Lauda prevailed over Prost by half a
                                        point — the narrowest margin in F1 history. The McLaren-TAGs remained strong in
                                        1985, bringing home a third Constructors' Championship, while this time Prost
                                        claimed the Drivers' title. In 1986, the Williams team surged back into
                                        contention with their Honda engine and the driver pairing of Nigel Mansell and
                                        Nelson Piquet. At McLaren, Lauda's replacement, 1982 champion Keke Rosberg,
                                        struggled to connect with the car. Williams secured the Constructors' title, but
                                        with wins in San Marino, Monaco, and Austria, Prost stayed in the title hunt.
                                        Because the Williams drivers split points throughout the season, Prost still had
                                        a chance heading into the final race — the Australian Grand Prix. A puncture for
                                        Mansell and a precautionary pit stop for Piquet handed Prost the victory and his
                                        second World Championship, making him the first driver to win back-to-back
                                        titles since Jack Brabham in 1959 and 1960. In 1987, John Barnard left McLaren
                                        to join Ferrari and was replaced by Steve Nichols, who would also later move to
                                        Ferrari in 1989. In the hands of Prost and Stefan Johansson, however, Nichols's
                                        MP4/3 paired with the TAG engine couldn't match the pace of the Williams-Honda.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> For 1988, Honda switched their supply to McLaren and, encouraged by Prost,
                                        Dennis signed Ayrton Senna to drive. Despite regulations reducing the boost
                                        pressure and fuel capacity (and therefore power) of the turbo cars, Honda
                                        persisted with a turbocharged engine. In the MP4/4, Senna and Prost engaged in a
                                        season-long battle, winning 15 of the 16 races. At the other race, the Italian
                                        Grand Prix at Monza, Senna had been leading comfortably but collided with
                                        back-marker Jean-Louis Schlesser.At the Portuguese Grand Prix, their
                                        relationship soured when Senna squeezed Prost against the pit wall; Prost won,
                                        but afterwards remarked, "It was dangerous. If he wants the world championship
                                        that badly he can have it." Prost actually scored more points overall that year,
                                        but due to a rule that only the best 11 results counted toward the championship,
                                        Senna took the title at the penultimate race in Japan.</p>
                                    <p>The next year, with turbos banned, Honda supplied a new 3.5-L naturally aspirated
                                        V10 engine, and McLaren again won both titles with the MP4/5. Their drivers'
                                        relationship continued to deteriorate, though, especially when, at the San
                                        Marino Grand Prix, Prost felt that Senna had reneged on an agreement not to pass
                                        each other at the first corner. Believing that Honda and Dennis were favouring
                                        Senna, Prost announced mid-season that he would leave to drive at Ferrari the
                                        following year. For the second year in succession, the Drivers' Championship was
                                        decided at the Japanese Grand Prix, this time in Prost's favour after Senna and
                                        he collided (Senna initially recovered and won the race, but was later
                                        disqualified). </p>
                                    <p> With former McLaren men Nichols and Prost (Barnard had moved to the Benetton
                                        team), Ferrari pushed the British team more closely in 1990. McLaren, in turn,
                                        brought in Ferrari's Gerhard Berger, but like the two seasons before, the
                                        Drivers' Championship was led by Prost and Senna and settled at the penultimate
                                        race in Japan. Here, Senna collided with Prost at the first corner, forcing both
                                        to retire, but this time Senna escaped punishment and took the title; McLaren
                                        also won the Constructors' Championship. The 1991 year was another for McLaren
                                        and Senna, with the ascendant Renault-powered Williams team their closest
                                        challengers. By 1992, Williams, with their advanced FW14B car, had overtaken
                                        McLaren, breaking their four-year run as champions, despite the latter winning
                                        five races that year.</p>

                        As Honda withdrew from the sport at the end of 1992, McLaren sought a new engine supplier. A
                        deal to secure Renault engines fell through; subsequently, McLaren switched to customer Ford
                        engines for the 1993 season. Senna—who initially agreed only to a race-by-race contract before
                        later signing for the whole year—won five races, including a record-breaking sixth victory at
                        Monaco and a win at the European Grand Prix, where he went from fifth to first on the opening
                        lap. His teammate, 1991 CART champion Michael Andretti, fared much worse; he scored only seven
                        points and was replaced by test driver Mika Häkkinen for the final three rounds of the season.
                        Williams ultimately won both titles, and Senna—who had flirted with moving there for 1993—signed
                        with them for the 1994 season. During the 1993 season, McLaren took part in a seven-part BBC
                        Television documentary called A Season With McLaren.

                                        deciding to use Peugeot engines. With Peugeot power, the MP4/9 was driven by
                                        Häkkinen and Martin Brundle. Despite achieving eight podiums over the season, no
                                        wins were achieved. Peugeot was dropped after a single year due to multiple
                                        engine failures and unreliability, which cost McLaren potential race victories,
                                        and they switched to a Mercedes-Benz-branded, Ilmor-designed engine.</p>
